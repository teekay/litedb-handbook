# Introduction

.NET developers have long had one embedded database option when developing for desktop or mobile: [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html).

It is an excellent option.

Nevertheless, it’s no longer the only option.

Maybe your use case is document-centric. Maybe you only need a few relations to model your domain. Maybe you want a developer experience that feels more native to C# and .NET.

If that describes you, there’s a good chance that [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/) could be for you.

## Assumptions and constraints

This is a short book that assumes a few things about you:

- you are a .NET developer
- you are familiar with SQLite and have a general understanding of the SQL standard
- you have heard about LiteDB and want to know how it compares to SQLite

Does this describe you? If so, then read on!

You don’t have to know SQLite in detail to benefit from reading this. You don’t even need to be well-versed in SQL; if you’ve only ever used ORMs (object-relationship mappers) like Entity Framework, you’ll find how to use an equivalent approach with LiteDB.

The only hard constraint is the .NET part. LiteDB only has a .NET API.

## What you’ll get by reading this book

Life is short, so here is my promise to you. After you have read this book, which shouldn’t take more than 30-60 minutes, you will be able to:

- understand the conceptual differences between LiteDB and SQLite as well as features they have in common
- make an informed argument for when to use SQLite and when LiteDB might be the more appropriate choice
- get a good grasp of the various APIs and programming models that LiteDB makes available to you, and understand how they compare to SQLite APIs
- evaluate what it takes to install and set up LiteDB in your app vis-a-vis SQLite
- review a roadmap for migrating an existing app from SQLite to LiteDB and customize it for your use case

This is not a philosophical treatise but a pragmatic handbook for a busy programmer. You’ll find code samples throughout, and should you want to play along, download or fork the [Github repo.](https://github.com/teekay/litedb-sqlite-handbook)

## What is not included

I wrote this handbook to explain how to use LiteDB for embedded scenarios. SQLite is used for reference purposes.

Therefore, we don’t discuss SQLite more than is necessary to highlight the similarities and differences between the two databases. If you want to learn more about SQLite, there are other excellent [books](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/using-sqlite/9781449394592/) on the subject.

This is also not the definitive guide to LiteDB. It will give you more than enough to get started but expect to visit the [official docs](https://www.litedb.org/docs/) for more - when you need it.

## About the author

Hi, I am [Tom](https://tomaskohl.com)!

I’ve been developing with C# and .NET since 2013 or so.

My desktop app for tango DJs - [Bewitched](https://tomaskohl.com/apps/bewitched/) - uses SQLite for data storage. At some point, I was looking for a possible alternative since using SQLite in .NET has a few caveats, mostly due to it being a compiled C binary that needs wrappers in .NET.

And, I found LiteDB.

After documenting my initial impressions in a blog post, I found out that other people are interested in LiteDB and how it compares to SQLite. That’s why I decided to create this little handbook.
