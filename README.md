# LiteDB vs SQLite: a comparison for .NET developers

## Purpose of this document

I want to test the waters and create a tiny info-product based on the Google juice I have for the LiteDB article.

I would create a PDF, put it on Gumroad, make it free but let people pay if they want to, then link to the Gumroad page from the blog post. And see.

### Decisions

- how long should it be? â†’ Iâ€™d say 20-50 pages max.
- do I contact the LiteDB makers and ask for a review? â†’ Iâ€™d say yes, I could get valuable feedback and a chance to correct mistakes, and possibly also an endorsement

### Risks

- Not having a CS background, how do I competently compare things like indexes? â†’ get a review by LiteDB makers ðŸ˜œ

### Upside potential (=why do this)

- learn a little about making and marketing info-products
- generate a tiny side income (no expectations, though)
- leverage the experience to make a bigger bet

## The value proposition

This will be a practical, hands-on guide that should answer the following questions:

- what are the differences between SQLite and LiteDB on a high level?
- what can LiteDB do for me that SQLite cannot, and vice versa?
- when to use SQLite, and when to use LiteDB?
- how easy is it to set up LiteDB compared to SQLite in a new C# project?
- how do I migrate from SQLite to LiteDB in an existing project?
